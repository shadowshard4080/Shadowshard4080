- I am Shadowshard, the werewolf software dev.
- I’m interested in audio sciences, Free and Open Source Software, and developing CLI programs.
- I know HTML, CSS, C+, C++, Java, Javascript, and Python.
- How to reach me: Contact me on Discord at `@thewildwerewolf`. I am always available to messages. Friend requests from people I don't know are ignored, so message me first (join a community I'm in, like the Arch Linux community: https://discord.gg/tjERsv9JGy). Messages that merely say "hi" will be ignored. State your purpose.
